Description: Create an NFT marketplace on Ethereum/an Ethereum-like blockchain

1) Create a basic serverless React app using Firebase (maybe with a nodejs backend if required)
2) The user will be able to login with their Metamask wallet/account
3) There will be a "Create NFT" page with a form for the user to input data and a file
4) On submission of the form, an NFT will be minted on blockchain and accessible in their wallet
5) Create a page that showcases all the NFTs minted by users with an option to purchase it
6) Facilitate the exchange of NFT for crytpocurrency with a small fee extracted to a stored address
